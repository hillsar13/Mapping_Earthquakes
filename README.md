# Mapping_Earthquakes

## Purpose
The purpose of this repository was to see the earthquake data in relation to the tectonic platesâ€™ location on the earth, the earthquakes with a magnitude greater than 4.5 on the map, and to see the data on a third map.

## Results & Conclusions
We were able to successfully add the tectonic plate lines to our map, filter appropriately for earthquakes with a magnitue greater than 4.5 on the map, and to view the data on a third map. This was an excellent opportunity to continue ti implement our skillset using GeoJSON datasets.
